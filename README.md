# oop_python_workshop
The main.py is the product of the workshop at https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/.
The DOGO Directory contains a small project I started to practice the stuff I learned in the workshop.
It's a unfinished small text based RPG using object oriented programming to make stuff easier.
